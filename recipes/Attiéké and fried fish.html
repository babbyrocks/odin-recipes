    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Attiéké</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups attiéké (fermented cassava couscous)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Fried Fish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 whole tilapia or mackerel, cleaned and gutted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Lime or lemon wedges (optional)</li>
        <li>Avocado pear</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place attiéké in a bowl. Sprinkle with water and a pinch of salt. Mix with a fork to separate the grains. Cover and steam over boiling water for about 5–10 minutes or microwave for 2–3 minutes until warm and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Season the cleaned fish with garlic, ginger, paprika, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for 15–30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan and fry the fish until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Prepare the garnish by mixing sliced onions, tomatoes, cucumber, and optional pepper. Add a pinch of salt and a few drops of lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Serve the attiéké with fried fish on the side, topped with the fresh vegetable garnish. Add lime or lemon wedges if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Attiéké is best enjoyed with fresh spicy pepper sauce (shito or chili vinaigrette). You can also serve it with grilled chicken or boiled eggs (since Ghanaians apparently love eggs so much) instead of fish.</p>
